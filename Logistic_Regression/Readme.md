# Classification - Logisitic Regression

A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”. A classification model attempts to draw some conclusion from observed values. Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to predict the value of one or more outcomes.
For example, when filtering emails “spam” or “not spam”<br/>

In statistics, the logistic model  is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose etc. Each object being detected  would be assigned a probability between 0 and 1 and the sum adding to one.

## Problem statement 
Given a data set of the users of social media , a company wants to predicts the class of users who are most likely to buy a SUV so that they can target them for their ad campaign.<br/>
